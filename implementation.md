## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns, detects wins and draws, and offers a restart functionality.

## File Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the game's HTML structure
- `styles.css`: Defines the game's appearance
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic

## HTML Structure

The `index.html` file contains the following key elements:

1. A container div with class `game-container`
2. A heading (h1) for the game title
3. A div with id `status-display` to show game status
4. A div with class `game-board` containing nine cell divs
5. A restart button with id `restart`
6. A footer with creator information

Key HTML snippet:

```html
<div class="game-container">
    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    <div id="status-display">Player X's turn</div>
    <div class="game-board">
        <div class="cell" data-cell-index="0"></div>
        <!-- ... (cells 1-7) ... -->
        <div class="cell" data-cell-index="8"></div>
    </div>
    <button id="restart">Restart Game</button>
</div>
```

## CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file defines the game's visual appearance. Key styling aspects include:

1. Game container layout and styling
2. Responsive grid for the game board
3. Cell styling and hover effects
4. Player symbol (X and O) styles
5. Button styling
6. Responsive design for smaller screens

Key CSS snippets:

```css
.game-board {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.cell {
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
    background-color: #ecf0f1;
    border: 2px solid #bdc3c7;
    border-radius: 5px;
    font-size: 2em;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

## JavaScript Logic

The `script.js` file contains the game's logic. Key components include:

1. Game state variables
2. Winning conditions array
3. Cell click handler
4. Game state update functions
5. Win/draw detection
6. Player turn management
7. Game restart functionality

Key JavaScript functions:

```javascript
function handleCellClick(clickedCellEvent) {
    // ... (check if the move is valid)
    handleCellPlayed(clickedCell, clickedCellIndex);
    handleResultValidation();
}

function handleResultValidation() {
    // ... (check for win or draw)
    handlePlayerChange();
}

function handleRestartGame() {
    // ... (reset game state)
}
```

## Game Flow

1. The game initializes with Player X's turn.
2. Players click on empty cells to make their moves.
3. After each move, the game checks for a win or draw condition.
4. If no win or draw, the turn passes to the other player.
5. When a player wins or the game draws, a message is displayed.
6. Players can restart the game at any time using the restart button.

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for improvement include:

1. Implementing an AI opponent
2. Adding animations for placing symbols and winning
3. Implementing a score tracking system
4. Adding sound effects
5. Creating different difficulty levels for AI

To implement these enhancements, modify the existing JavaScript logic and add new functions as needed. Ensure to update the HTML and CSS accordingly for any new UI elements.
